Expectation
This is a Rooms-to-go : React shopping-cart at-home coding exercise.

I developed this rtg-shopping-cart simple single page application with react-redux and articulated the tests with jest-enzyme.
Used the visual studio's IDE .
Styled with Css3 Sass library.

Using this application, the user can add and remove the furniture products to the cart and also can calculate the subtotals, shipping, taxes, and the total amounts.

The elements and the subtotal, taxes and the shipping cost applied in the cart:

PRODUCT NAME
PRODUCT PRICE
PRODUCT QUANTITY
SUBTOTAL (does not include TAX or SHIPPING COST)
TAX (@10%)
SHIPPING COST ($50 + 2%) - ($5 \* TOTAL QUANTITY)
TOTAL COST

The interface allows the user to;

ADD an item to the shopping cart.
REMOVE items from the shopping cart.
UPDATE the quantity of items in the cart.
SHOW the Subtotal.
SHOW the Tax amount.
SHOW the Delivery amount.
SHOW the Total.
